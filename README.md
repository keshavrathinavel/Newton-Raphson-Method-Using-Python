# Newton-Raphson-Method-Using-Python
Newton Raphson Method is a popular iterative method used to solve transcendental equations. In Engineering Mathematics Courses, this is a popular concept. Here, I will be showing you how I employed simple code to solve a polynomial equation via the said method.
This iterative method of determining the roots of the function is termed after Issac Newton and Joseph Raphson. According to this method, the X-intercept of the tangent drawn at the initial guess point is the better approximation for the root of the function.

Limitations:

Despite of having fastest convergence to the root, this method has few limitations as follows:

- Derivative of the function must be known (which might be difficult in some cases).

- The speed of convergence may depend on initial guess.

-  May encounter zero value for derivative.
